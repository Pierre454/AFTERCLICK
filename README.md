# AFTER'CLICK

During interactive or other courses, it is common to use remote controls called clikers, but this is not practical because it must always be kept with us. The objective being to design a software to create and manage questionnaires for the teacher, as well as a mobile application for students to connect to it and answer questions directly on their phones, in order to replace clikers.  I took care of the questionnaire part, including many functionalities.
